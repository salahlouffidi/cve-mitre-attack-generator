This project generates MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques for CVE IDs by leveraging the OpenAI API. It reads the CVE IDs from a CSV file and retrieves the corresponding techniques using natural language generation.
# CVE MITRE ATT&CK Technique Generator

This project reads CVE IDs from a CSV file and uses the OpenAI API to generate MITRE ATT&CK techniques for each CVE ID.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- openai library (can be installed via `pip install openai`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/salahlouffidi/cve-mitre-attack-generator.git

Obtain an OpenAI API key:

Sign up on the OpenAI website if you don't have an account.
Generate an API key in your account settings.
Update the API key in the code:
Open the file generate_mitre_techniques.py.
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.

Prepare the CSV file:

Create a CSV file named trans.csv in the project directory.
Add the CVE IDs you want to generate MITRE ATT&CK techniques for. Place each ID in a separate row in the first column.

Run the script:
python generate_mitre_techniques.py

The script will read the CVE IDs from the CSV file and generate MITRE ATT&CK techniques using the OpenAI API.
The generated techniques will be displayed in the console for each CVE ID.

CSV File Format
The CSV file (trans.csv) should follow the following format:
CVE-2021-XXXX
CVE-2021-YYYY
...
